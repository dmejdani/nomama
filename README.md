## Goal
Design, build and deploy a web app that can keep track of our expenses. The prices, quantity, and the date of the goods should be taken from the shop receipt. Preferably, the technologies used should be free for personal use. 

## Implementation
>❗Design change to a framework in python.

We decided on using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) together with [Dash/Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/).
